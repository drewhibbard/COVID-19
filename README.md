# COVID-19

In this investigation I take a deep dive into coronavirus data using the following data sources:

- Worldometer.info
- COVID Tracking Project API
- Tableau COVID-19 Web Data Connector

I will use Plotly to create interactive visuals of world data, and also create a Tableau Dashboard with data that goes down to the county level.  

The COVID Tracking Project does not have county-level data, but does include useful info on hospitalizations, ventilators, and ICUs.
