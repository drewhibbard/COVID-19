# COVID-19

In this investigation I take a deep dive into coronavirus data using the following data sources:

- [Worldometer.info](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/)
- [COVID Tracking Project API](https://covidtracking.com/data/api)
- [Tableau COVID-19 Web Data Connector](https://www.tableau.com/covid-19-coronavirus-data-resources)

I will use Plotly to create interactive visuals of world data, and also create a Tableau Dashboard with data that goes down to the county level.  

The COVID Tracking Project does not have county-level data, but does include useful info on hospitalizations, ventilators, and ICUs. 

Check out the dashboard yourself at my [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/profile/drew.hibbard#!/)!
